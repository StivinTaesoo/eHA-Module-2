            The <em>Peacock</em> is awesome because
            <strong>of it's beauty and elegance</strong>. <br />
            When you think of a peacock, the image that likely comes to mind is
            of a bird with breathtaking, colorful tail feathers fanned out in a
            majestic display. However, the vibrant, eye-catching birds that we
            all know and love are actually males. Female peafowls, known as
            peahens, are far less conspicuous with their muted gray and brown
            feathers. Unlike the males, who are often seen flaunting their
            plumage in parks, farms, and zoos, the females are more elusive and
            rarely spotted in the same grandeur. The fan display, known as
            “train rattling,” is an exclusive male behavior, driven by the need
            to attract a mate. The striking peacock you admire is a rarity, a
            male in full regalia, while the subtler peahen often goes unnoticed.
