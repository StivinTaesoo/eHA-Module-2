                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
                    <li>1 onion, peeled and chopped</li>
                    <li>2 carrots, peeled and diced</li>
                    <li>500g minced beef</li>
                    <li>250g chestnut mushrooms, sliced</li>
                    <li>2 level tbsp plain flour</li>
                    <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
                    <li>Dash of Worcestershire sauce</li>
                    <li>450g mashed potato</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    <h4>Method</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the onion
                            and carrots and cook over medium heat for about 5
                            minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables
                            have started to soften.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the beef to the pan and cook for about 5-10
                            minutes, stirring to break up the meat, until it
                            browns. Once the meat is crumbly, stir occasionally
                            to prevent it from sticking and burning, but don’t
                            keep stirring it, otherwise, it just cools the
                            mixture, rather than letting the meat brown.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the beef to the pan and cook for about 5-10
                            minutes, stirring to break up the meat, until it
                            browns. Once the meat is crumbly, stir occasionally

                        <li>
                            Add the mushrooms to the pan and cook for a few
                            minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sprinkle over the flour, then mix it in well and
                            cook for 3-4 minutes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pour in the can of tomatoes, sprinkle in the stock
                            cube, and bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the
                            heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, until it
                            thickens slightly and the vegetables are tender. If
                            the sauce seems very thick, just add a little
                            boiling water.
                        </li>
                        <li>Set oven to 200C (180C fan, Gas 6).</li>
                        <li>
                            Stir the Worcestershire sauce into mince and season
                            with salt and pepper. Spoon the filling into an
                            oven-dish and level the surface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Spread the mashed potato over the mince and score
                            the surface with a fork. Top with a knob of butter,
                            if using. Bake in the centre of the oven for 20-30
                            minutes, or until the mash is golden and the filling
                            is bubbling. Serve straight from the oven.

                    <h4>What should you serve with cottage pie?</h4>

                    <p>
                        Cottage pie is such a hearty meal you don’t have to
                        serve it with anything if you’re happy with just the
                        pie, however, if you’re looking for a side, a steaming
                        bowl of freshly cooked greens is a good choice. Opt for
                        Tenderstem broccoli, runner beans, or peas, of if you
                        want something a little more decadent, try creamy
                        spinach with cheese. <br />
                        <br />
                        If you’re serving cottage pie in the summer months you
                        might opt for a lighter side of a freshly prepared
                        salad. Some people also serve bread and butter with
                        their cottage pie to mop up leftover juices from the
                        pies' gravy.

                    <p>
                        Making a perfect Victoria sponge cake is all about
                        practising and sticking to the recipe. If you get all
                        your ingredients out beforehand to measure and prep,
                        this will make the mixing process so much easier and you
                        can keep tabs on what’s going in too so you don’t miss
                        any ingredients out.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Put the sugar and melted butter in a bowl and mix
                            together with a wooden spoon. Sift the flour, baking
                            powder and salt together and mix into the sugar and
                            butter mixture.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the vanilla and chocolate chips and use your
                            hands to distribute evenly and mix together. Once
                            you get a dough texture, add the egg and knead using
                            your hands again until combined.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Portion the dough into 20 balls. Put on the baking
                            tray and flatten a little.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Keep the balls small and leave plenty of space
                            between each one as they will spread. You might
                            prefer to bake in batches or use two baking trays.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bake for 10-20 minutes until lightly golden and
                            golden at the edges. Leave to cool on the baking
                            tray for 10 minutes, or if you have time until
                            completely cool.
                        </li>

                    <h4>How do you make soft, chewy chocolate chip cookies?</h4>

                    <p>
                        We’d recommend swapping caster sugar for brown sugar -
                        as it contains molasses, which will add even more
                        moisture to your cookies making them extra soft and
                        chewy.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can also reduce the baking time - not drastically -
                        by a few minutes and can immediately remove them from
                        the baking tray once out of the oven to cool on a wire
                        rack to stop them from continuing to cook for too long.
                        Doing this will stop the cookies from overcooking which
                        can cause them to dry out and become crisp.

                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 medium whole chicken</li>
                    <li>40g butter</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
                    <li>6 rashers of streaky bacon</li>
                    <li>bunch of sage, for garnish</li>
                    <li>50g butter, softened</li>
                    <li>4 large onions, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>10 sage leaves, chopped</li>
                    <li>125g breadcrumbs</li>
                    <li>salt and pepper</li>
                    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    <h4>Method</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 190°C/375°F/Gas 5.</li>
                        <li>
                            First, make the stuffing. Melt the butter and add
                            the onions. Gently cook for about 10 mins until the
                            onions are soft. Allow to cool and add the sage,
                            breadcrumbs and season. Add just enough egg to
                            moisten the mixture and leave until ready to use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stuff the chicken from the neck end, and pack about
                            two-thirds of the stuffing inside. Close the skin
                            over the stuffing and secure it with a cocktail
                            stick or small skewer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shape the remaining stuffing into balls and place on
                            a baking sheet. Cook in the oven with the chicken,
                            but don't put them in until the final 25 mins of
                            cooking.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Place the chicken in a roasting tin and spread with
                            butter. Season the chicken with the salt and pepper
                            to taste. Arrange the bacon in a criss-cross pattern
                            across the breast. Cover loosely with foil.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Roast in the centre of oven for 20 mins per 500g
                            plus 10-20 mins extra, basting twice during cooking.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fifteen mins before end of cooking time, remove the
                            foil, remove the bacon, baste and increase the heat
                            to 220ºC/425°F/gas 7, to give the skin that final
                            golden crispiness. When it is cooked, remove it from
                            the oven and cover it with foil. Leave to rest for
                            at least 10 mins before serving. The juices should
                            run clear when the thigh is pierced. If not, cook
                            further.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Garnish with a bunch of sage and serve with a
                            selection of roasted vegetables.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
