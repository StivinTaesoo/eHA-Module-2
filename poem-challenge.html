        <h1>The Night Comes</h1>
        <p>
            The daylight grows deem <br />
            As the sun goes to sleep <br />
            The thunderous silence overtakes the forest <br />
            The distant whispers of the insects <br />
            The melodious songs of the birds <br />
            The gushing flow of the waters from the nigh rivers <br />
            Echoes from the sounds of the gentle wind <br />
            The night comes with a blinding darkness <br />
            As creatures awaits the morning's brightness <br />
            The moon steps up with a ray of hope <br />
            On an on the circle goes <br />
            Such is the wonder of life's scope
        </p>
